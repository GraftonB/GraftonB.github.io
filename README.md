## Professional Self Assessment
Completing the CS program coursework has been an incredible journey that's strengthened my foundation in numerous ways. From the core programming concepts to the ins and outs of data structures, I've had to learn a variety of things that have given me a comprehensive grasp of the field of computer science.

In the beginning, I tackled programming basics, delving into the complex realm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and exploring a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. This adventure felt like deciphering intricate codes that bring applications and systems to life.

However, my journey was about more than just coding skills. I've developed important life skills along the way. Breaking down complex projects that felt impossible into manageable tasks became both a satisfying mental challenge and an exercise in patience and frustration tolerance. 

As I continued my studies, I began to understand the importance of software security. I learned about the value of using secure coding practices to protect software systems from potential threats. In the field of databases, I've also developed the ability to organize and manage data repositories effectively. Combining this skill with my knowledge of APIs and full-stack development, I've been able to create smooth and interconnected digital systems. I've had to understand at a deep level how different components interact with eachother, providing much of the content that we interface with everyday.

In addition to this, I had to learn about the world of software design patterns, which is like using architectural plans to build strong and reliable software solutions. This skill has enhanced my grasp of software engineering best practices, making sure that my code isn't just effective but also aligns with industry norms.

Furthermore, my exploration led me to concepts such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which was utilized in CS-465 Fullstack Development. This framework, which separates the application into three interconnected components – the model (data and logic), the view (user interface), and the controller (input control) – has provided me with a structured approach to designing applications that are both modular and easily maintainable. Understanding how these components interact and influence each other has been instrumental in developing intuitive and user-friendly software.

Another noteworthy concept that I've encountered is the Singleton design pattern. This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Incorporating the Singleton pattern in my projects has helped me manage shared resources efficiently and maintain a coherent state throughout the application. This not only contributes to streamlined code but also improves the overall performance and user experience.

Incorporating MVC and Singleton, along with other design patterns and architectural principles, has allowed me to go beyond writing functional code. It has enabled me to create software solutions that are  scalable, maintanable, and aligned with industry standards, setting the foundations for me to become a more effective and proficient software developer.

Going into this program I was afraid of Math, traditionally I didn't "do well" in Math classes. Math has played a large role in my journey through this program, strengthening my problem-solving skills and understanding of intricate algorithms. From algebra to statistics, discrete math to linear algebra, and even calculus 1 and 2, these mathematical subjects, which I successfully learned, have both increased my confidence in many subjects, but also in my capability to learn.

As I explored the realms of computer science, algebra equipped me with a toolkit for expressing abstract ideas and relationships in concrete terms. Statistics lent a critical eye to data interpretation, allowing me to draw meaningful insights from the information at hand. Discrete math provided me with a new way of thinking, the mathematical logic that is present throughout algorithms, helping me better understand their inner workings.

Linear algebra introduced me to the practice of manipulating vectors and matrices, a skill set I later found to be very important for understanding various data transformation processes within programming. On the other hand, calculus was a huge challenge for me, and I didn't love learning it. However, I do recognize its role in the world of computer science. Applying concepts learned through calculus I was able to understand the intricacies of change and accumulation, helping me understand how variables and functions evolve, which is crucial for the foundation of computational systems.

In closing, my journey through the CS program has equipped me with a variety of skills that extend beyond coding proficiency. From understanding mathematical concepts to applying  algorithms, and from developing efficient code structures to securing software , each subject has contributed to my holistic growth as an emerging computer scientist. My learning journey was filled with frustration, overwhelming feelings that "I can't do it", to always eventually pushing through and succeeding.

In my portfolio, I've curated three distinct artifacts representing Software Engineering and Design, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Databases. These artifacts aren't just assignments; they're milestones reflecting my growth in these categories. Each artifact across every category reflects the improvements I've made as a computer scientist since the start of my journey along the CS program here at SNHU.
