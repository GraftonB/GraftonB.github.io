## Enhancement Two: Data Structures and Algorithms ##

### Artifact Description ###

The chosen artifact for Milestone 3 is the Wellness Slide Show application designed for CS-250, Software Development Lifecycle. The artifact is written in Java and utilizes the Java Window Builder.

### Justification for Inclusion ###

I have selected the Slide Show application for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my proficiency in data structures and algorithms (DSA). The artifact showcases my ability to evaluate an existing application critically and identify areas for improvement related to DSA. During the enhancement process, I successfully implemented changes that enhance efficiency, performance, maintainability, functionality, and reusability of the code, particularly focusing on two significant aspects: Slide Data Structure and Dynamic Slide Management.

### Reflection on the Enhancement Process ###

Throughout the enhancement process, I focused on eliminating redundancies across the application, streamlining the code, and commenting the more complex functions to provide information for future development. This approach improved the application's performance and simplified the user interface, resulting in more concise, reusable, and maintainable code. By critically evaluating the code and identifying areas for improvement, I expanded my knowledge of software design patterns, libraries, and methods, strengthening my understanding of best practices in software development.

### Feedback Incorporation and Artifact Improvement ###

I addressed the Slide Data Structure by creating a Slide class that encapsulates the image and description for each slide. This improvement provided a more organized and cohesive approach to handle slide information, ensuring that the image and description data are always synchronized. By utilizing either an Array to store instances of the Slide class, I established a unified data structure to manage the slides efficiently. This enhancement not only simplified operations but also contributed to making the code more maintainable and less prone to errors when updating or modifying slide information.

I also tackled the issue of hardcoded arrays with a fixed size of 5, which impeded scalability. To resolve this limitation, I replaced the fixed-size arrays with a dynamic data structure, namely an ArrayList. This change enables users to dynamically add or remove slides at runtime, providing more flexibility to the application. By introducing a constant `NUM_SLIDES` and utilizing the dynamic data structure, the application became more adaptable to changing requirements without extensive code modifications. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to design computing solutions that can adjust to varying scenarios, making the application more user-friendly and robust.

Additionally, I enhanced the functionality of the Slide Show application through the introduction of the "Random" button. This feature showcases my efficient use and application of DSA. The implementation required an understanding of algorithms to randomly select slides and improve user experience by providing a new experience each time the button is clicked.

### Alignment with Course Objectives ###

By implementing these enhancements, I hope to improve performance through optimized Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Utilizing a data structure like an array over the current implementation will greatly improve performance, with lower time and space complexity. The Wellness Retreat Slideshow will also be much more scalable because of implementing dynamic array sizes. The code will be more maintainable, functional, and reusable because of these enhancements.

This enhancements has illustrated my understanding of the importance of DSA, as well as provide insight into my problem-solving methodology, analytical thinking, and general programming skills. This enhancement will meet the course outcome of "Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices."

In conclusion, the enhancements made to the Slide Show application exemplify my ability to review an application and identify/make improvements related to DSA, which enhance efficiency, performance, maintainability, functionality, and reusability. These skills are essential in the field of computer science as they ensure the delivery of high-quality solutions that meet industry-specific goals while adhering to best practices and standards. Through this project, I have demonstrated my competence in designing and evaluating computing solutions, effectively managing trade-offs in design choices, and using well-founded techniques and tools to deliver valuable applications. The Slide Show application serves as a testament to my growth as a computer scientist, and I am confident that it showcases my progress toward demonstrating desired course outcomes.
